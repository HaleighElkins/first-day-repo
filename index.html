                <p> Hi, my name is Haleigh Elkins and I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I have worked in finance for the last 4 years and before finance I worked in retail management for 7 years. In both careers I was never fully challenged and Iâ€™m looking for a job more challenging for myself. I have always loved working with computers and I have always been the person everyone goes to for computer problems in my personal and professional life. 
                    I love all things vintage but also love playing video games. I have two beautiful golden retrievers who keep me on my toes every single day.</p>
